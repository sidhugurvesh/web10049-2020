## Instructions

Complete "Marking Up A Letter"
The  [tutorial Marking Up A Letter on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter) contains lists (session 4) and links (session 3),... 

1. Make sure to complete all tutorials, including the prerequisite listed by MDN before attempting this assignment. (Assignments are summative, tutorials are formative!)

2. Start your file with minimal HTML5 document. 
3. Add comments. Complete prologue (header) and include all instructions as part of Description.

4. DO NOT USE any styles! (**ignore CSS; address and date will be left-aligned, otherwise it should look like the given image**)

5. If there is something that cannot be done with pure HTML5, it needs to be documented as comments in the code. Do not use the `address` element for the addressee. Check out the intended usage on w3schools and w3.org. 

6. Create project directory `markup_letter` in directory `C:\public_html\syst10049`. Add and enhance with your own research using primary sources. Test, validate, and practice publishing.

7. Bring questions to next class and show me your progress.

8. Show your instructor your code for immediate feedback and opportunity to improve. Read through the self-evaluation rubric below. Make sure your code is validated, update and add all comments, use proper indentation.  **Get feedback before publishing to ensure you have not missed or misinterpreted anything to get full marks!**

9. Publish on server `http://username.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/syst10049/markup_letter/index.html`
10. Submit in SLATE  dropbox by the due date.

## A Guideline for Implementing Good Solutions
The development process is the same for any programming language! Before you start designing a solution, make sure you understand the problem - a process called  **analyzing**.

The purpose of programming exercises and assignments, regardless of the language, is to learn:
-   how to correctly formulate algorithms to solve specific problems - a process called  **designing**
-   how to write those algorithms as programs in the given programming language - a process called  **coding**  (or sometimes  **constructing**)
-   how to test a program to provide convincing evidence that it solves the right problem correctly - a process called  **testing**
-   how to provide a clear, concise explanation of the problem that the program is intended to solve, and how it works - a process called  **documenting**

### Self-evaluation Rubric

A program can compile (be interpreted) correctly, produce the correct output, and still have major problems. Here are some guidelines for the categories:

(1) algorithm design,
(2) program style, and
(3) program correctness.

**Algorithm design**	
Algorithm design  is a measure of how well the algorithm has been designed. For example, if the solution calls for a recursive algorithm to be implemented. It is considered to be poorly designed if iterative structures are used. Another example: if the algorithm contains a  divide-by-zero instruction, has it been safeguarded against divide-by-zero errors? HTML example: using paragraphs  instead of line breaks.

 - *Programming structures:* Has the program been designed using the appropriate programming structures?
 -  *Program testing:* Is the program designed to work correctly for all input cases? What about error cases?
 -  *Error handling:* Is the program designed to give appropriate error messages for bad input data?

**Program Style**
Program style consists of documentation, source citations, naming conventions, readability and indentation.
 - *Comments (documentation)*: Use the appropriate comments for the language used. There should be a prologue (header) specifying at minimum the program name, author(s),date created, date updated, and a short description. Optionally, it may contain algorithm analysis (input, output), algorithm design (pseudo-code) outlining the approach used by the program to solve the problem, and known bugs (if the program does not function correctly in some situations, describe the situations and problems).
 -  *Source Citations:* In comments, reference all sources used (classroom, course material, references, videos, websites,...) and describe what changes you've made.
 - *Naming variables, files,...*: Each variable name should indicate its meaning. Counters can be named i,j,k and a character can be named simply c, but constructs that are specific to the particular program should have specific, mnemonic names. Good examples: `relativeError speed  sum  temperature  windChill`
 - *Readability and Indentation:* Indentation should indicate the flow of control. Statements that are nested within a control  statement, if, for, while, etc., should be indented  a constant distance of at least four (4) spaces. More deeply nested statements should be more deeply  indented. The opening brace delimiting a compound statement should be on a line by itself following  the control statement, and closing brace should be  on a line by itself. The indentation of the braces  should match the controlling statement, such as in  the case of the for statement or the if statement.  For alternative acceptable styles, consult the  conventions used for your current environment. In case of shell scripts, observe the same rules  as the braces.

**Program correctness**
Program correctness consists of ability to compile (or interpret) and correct result. Consider the following:	 
		&bull; Does the program compile (interpret) without any syntax errors or warnings?
		&bull; Does the program work correctly for all input (both correct and erroneous)?
		&bull; Does the program contain logic errors?

 - *Ability to Compile or Interpret without Errors:* The program should compile, or be interpreted, without any warnings or errors. Make sure you use the appropriate syntax when compiling/interpreting your program. The permissions on the script file should be set properly.
 - *Correct Results:* The program should be evaluated on whether it does exactly what the problem stipulates, not on efficiency or appropriateness of the code. Note that "exactly" implies that, if the desired output format has been specified explicitly, no deviation from that format is allowed. For example, if two numbers are to be printed on the same line, it would be an error if they are printed on two lines, no matter how certain you are that it would be better that way. Also consider:	(1) Does the program contain any logic errors? --infinite loops, mathematical errors,... (2) Is the output self-explanatory and well formatted?
