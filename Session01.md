Every program (process) has input and output. Computer programming is a process that starts with an original formulation of a problem to executable computer programs. Computer languages like human languages require you to use them in order to understand them.



[**Progressive enhancement** (wikiwand.com)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Progressive_enhancement)
> Progressive enhancement (PE) is a strategy for web design that emphasizes accessibility, semantic HTML markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies. PE consists of a set of core principles:
>-   basic content should be accessible to all web browsers
>-   basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers
>-  **sparse, semantic markup contains all content**
>-   enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS
>-   enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript
>-   end-user web browser preferences are respected
