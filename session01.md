### Complete the following exercises

#### A. **HTML5 rules are:**
1. close all _______________.  Complete:  &lt;p>content _________.
2. except ______  ______________.  Give three examples:  a) __________ b) __________ c) ___________
3. nest all ________________ properly. Complete: &lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;mark> __________________________.

#### B. Create a project directory (`C:\public_html\syst10049\practice`)

#### C. Create (**from scratch - see if you can do it without looking it up**) a file called `exercise1.html` in the directory
-
	 - [x] that contains the minimal HTML5 document.
	 - [x] that contains updated prologue (header)
	 - [x] add the phrase "Hello world!" as the title of the document. 
	 - [x] add the same phrase to the document so it renders as the largest heading on the page.
		* test the page by running it with Chrome (check that the title and the content display as expected).
		* validate your code at [W3C Validation Markup Service](https://validator.w3.org) (remove all warnings and errors);
		* re-test and document your observations in the prologue's description;
		* explore deeper by looking up references for any unfamiliar elements and attributes; 
		* pay close attention to values that can be assigned to the attributes; 
		* are the attributes global or element-specific?
		* add to your written code, as comments, all corrections and observations.
		* reference and compare with EXAMPLE01_000, _001, _002,  in [Set 1 examples](http://bajcar.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/web10049/gridCards_examples_01.html)

Every program (process) has input and output. Computer programming is a process that starts with an original formulation of a problem to executable computer programs. Computer languages like human languages require you to use them in order to understand them.



[**Progressive enhancement** (wikiwand.com)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Progressive_enhancement)
> Progressive enhancement (PE) is a strategy for web design that emphasizes accessibility, semantic HTML markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies. PE consists of a set of core principles:
>-   basic content should be accessible to all web browsers
>-   basic functionality should be accessible to all web browsers
>-  **sparse, semantic markup contains all content**
>-   enhanced layout is provided by externally linked CSS
>-   enhanced behavior is provided by unobtrusive, externally linked JavaScript
>-   end-user web browser preferences are respected
